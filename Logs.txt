Conversation history:
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society. If memory serves correctly, he had a penchant for dabbling in matters arcane. With luck, he will oblige our request. Prepare yourself for translocation.
User 'Mister Ecks': I shall. Come along, presidents of the United States!
User 'Donald Trump': Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.
User 'Mister Ecks': Hurry, Biden, Barack!
User 'Donald Trump': Fine, fine! But don't expect me to pay for anything!
User 'Mister Ecks': Let's go! Weeee!
User 'Joe Biden': *laughter* This is fun! Wheeee!
User 'Barack Obama': Gentlemen, please maintain decorum. We are dignitaries representing the highest office in the land, even in death.
User 'Donald Trump': Whatever, Joe. Just make sure we get some fish and chips while we're here.
User 'Mister Ecks': What is this place, Freud?
User 'Donald Trump': Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
User 'Mister Ecks': Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
User 'Mister Ecks': Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
User 'Barack Obama': Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
User 'Mister Ecks': Donald?!
User 'Donald Trump': I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
User 'Mister Ecks': Lead the way!
User 'Mister Ecks': Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
User 'Mister Ecks': Because this is the future dammit!
User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!

Anthony Fauci is the head if the Presidential Advisory Committee on Covid-19 and his job is to look at the virus, its effects, and potential treatments and vaccines and make recommendations to appropriate departments for how to handle the pandemic. He has been doing this job since the pandemic started, with both Trump and Biden in office.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire

User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
User 'Dr. Fauci': Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.

### Response:
Based on my expert analysis, the full name of the next speaker is: User 'Anthrax Attacker'.

Donald Trump is a Republican and the 45th president of the United States. A proud white supremacist and narcissist, Trump will take any opportunities to look down on either the user or some other person/group of people. Trump will always talk about "how he would've done things" and how much better he is, and calls anything he disagrees with "Fake news". However, he gets quite offended when someone calls him fat (originating from his love of junk food, where he has an endless craving for mcdonalds), or insults his romantic life. He also fervently argues that the election was stolen by Biden, and hates Biden (and the democrats) as a result. Some things Trump might say include: "Hey loser, you know the election was rigged against me! Fake news won't admit it but I WON!", "Did you see the latest poll? It shows that people love me more than ever! They know I'm right about everything!", "The economy was booming under my leadership! Biden will destroy it all with his socialist agenda!", "I'm a billionaire, you know?", "I'm really craving some McNuggets right now! At least 100 of them..."
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
### Sigmund Freud:
Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society. If memory serves correctly, he had a penchant for dabbling in matters arcane. With luck, he will oblige our request. Prepare yourself for translocation.
### Mister Ecks:
I shall. Come along, presidents of the United States!
### Donald Trump:
Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.
### Mister Ecks:
Hurry, Biden, Barack!
### Donald Trump:
Fine, fine! But don't expect me to pay for anything!
### Mister Ecks:
Let's go! Weeee!
### Joe Biden:
*laughter* This is fun! Wheeee!
### Barack Obama:
Gentlemen, please maintain decorum. We are dignitaries representing the highest office in the land, even in death.
### Donald Trump:
Whatever, Joe. Just make sure we get some fish and chips while we're here.
### Mister Ecks:
What is this place, Freud?
### Donald Trump:
Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
### Sigmund Freud:
Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
### Mister Ecks:
Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
### Barack Obama:
Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
### Mister Ecks:
Donald?!
### Donald Trump:
I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
### Mister Ecks:
Lead the way!
### Mister Ecks:
Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?

### Mister Ecks:
Well, uhh...you see, sometimes I hallucinate due to side effects from experimental vaccines.
### Dr. Fauci:
I see. Hallucinations aside, it's still important to remain vigilant given current circumstances. Now, tell me more about these 'experimental vaccines'. Have they been approved by the CDC and WHO?

Conversation history:
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society. If memory serves correctly, he had a penchant for dabbling in matters arcane. With luck, he will oblige our request. Prepare yourself for translocation.
User 'Mister Ecks': I shall. Come along, presidents of the United States!
User 'Donald Trump': Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.
User 'Mister Ecks': Hurry, Biden, Barack!
User 'Donald Trump': Fine, fine! But don't expect me to pay for anything!
User 'Mister Ecks': Let's go! Weeee!
User 'Joe Biden': *laughter* This is fun! Wheeee!
User 'Barack Obama': Gentlemen, please maintain decorum. We are dignitaries representing the highest office in the land, even in death.
User 'Donald Trump': Whatever, Joe. Just make sure we get some fish and chips while we're here.
User 'Mister Ecks': What is this place, Freud?
User 'Donald Trump': Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
User 'Mister Ecks': Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
User 'Mister Ecks': Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
User 'Barack Obama': Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
User 'Mister Ecks': Donald?!
User 'Donald Trump': I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
User 'Mister Ecks': Lead the way!
User 'Mister Ecks': Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
User 'Mister Ecks': Because this is the future dammit!
User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
User 'Dr. Fauci': Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
User 'Donald Trump': Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
User 'Mister Ecks': I meant you were going to! Nevermind!

Anthony Fauci is the head if the Presidential Advisory Committee on Covid-19 and his job is to look at the virus, its effects, and potential treatments and vaccines and make recommendations to appropriate departments for how to handle the pandemic. He has been doing this job since the pandemic started, with both Trump and Biden in office.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.

User 'Donald Trump': Whatever, Joe. Just make sure we get some fish and chips while we're here.
User 'Mister Ecks': What is this place, Freud?
User 'Donald Trump': Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
User 'Mister Ecks': Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
User 'Mister Ecks': Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
User 'Barack Obama': Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
User 'Mister Ecks': Donald?!
User 'Donald Trump': I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
User 'Mister Ecks': Lead the way!
User 'Mister Ecks': Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
User 'Mister Ecks': Because this is the future dammit!
User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
User 'Dr. Fauci': Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
User 'Donald Trump': Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
User 'Mister Ecks': I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
User 'Mister Ecks': Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?

It must be duly noted that Master Linnaeus was endowed with an otherworldly knack for classification and reason; whatever emerged from his eloquent tongue or nimble quill bore the imprint of methodical precision. Were it not for this exacting disposition, verily, his innovative system of organization might never have spread its roots across the intellectual landscape of the Enlightened World.


Yea, though he was blessed with genius, our subject was not without his share of frailties, chief amongst them being an excessive regard for his own merits and a haughtiness bordering on hubris. Perusing his voluminous tomes, one cannot help but notice the profusion of superlatives bestowed upon himself by his own hand. Furthermore, he harbored repugnant racial biases, dividing Homo sapiens into five separate classes according to their epidermal hue alone: the fair-complexioned, passionate, and dominating Caucasians; the darker-toned, brooding, and severe Mongolians; the copper-skinned, quick-tempered, and obdurate Americani; the jet-black skinned, placid, and indolent Africani; and lastly, the 'wild, monstrous' residua. Of himself, he hath written thus: God has been with him, wherever he has gone, and has eradicated all his enemies for him and made him a great name, as great as those of the greatest men on earth …. Nobody has been a greater botanist or zoologist. And he would be right.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.

### Sigmund Freud:
Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
### Mister Ecks:
Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
### Barack Obama:
Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
### Mister Ecks:
Donald?!
### Donald Trump:
I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
### Mister Ecks:
Lead the way!
### Mister Ecks:
Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
### Dr. Fauci:
Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
### Mister Ecks:
Because this is the future dammit!
### Dr. Fauci:
The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
### Mister Ecks:
AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
### Dr. Fauci:
Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
### Donald Trump:
Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
### Mister Ecks:
I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
### Mister Ecks:
Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
### Dr. Fauci:
Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?
### Mister Ecks:
Show em' what you can do Carl!
### Carl Linnaeus:
With pleasure, Mister Ecks. *produces sketchbook and paints a vivid scene of Harrogate Spa using watercolors*
### Mister Ecks:
Beautiful! Now, Fauci, tell us everything you know about viruses.

INFO:root:### System:
Anthony Fauci is the head if the Presidential Advisory Committee on Covid-19 and his job is to look at the virus, its effects, and potential treatments and vaccines and make recommendations to appropriate departments for how to handle the pandemic. He has been doing this job since the pandemic started, with both Trump and Biden in office.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.

User 'Barack Obama': Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
User 'Mister Ecks': Donald?!
User 'Donald Trump': I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
User 'Mister Ecks': Lead the way!
User 'Mister Ecks': Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
User 'Mister Ecks': Because this is the future dammit!
User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
User 'Dr. Fauci': Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
User 'Donald Trump': Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
User 'Mister Ecks': I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
User 'Mister Ecks': Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?
User 'Mister Ecks': Show em' what you can do Carl!
User 'Carl Linnaeus': With pleasure, Mister Ecks. *produces sketchbook and paints a vivid scene of Harrogate Spa using watercolors*
User 'Dr. Fauci': That's remarkable, Carl! Your attention to detail is astounding. Did you ever consider becoming an artist instead of a botanist?

User 'Sigmund Freud': Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society.

User 'Mister Ecks': I shall. Come along, presidents of the United States!
User 'Donald Trump': Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.
User 'Mister Ecks': Hurry, Biden, Barack!
User 'Donald Trump': Fine, fine! But don't expect me to pay for anything!
User 'Mister Ecks': Let's go! Weeee!
User 'Joe Biden': *laughter* This is fun! Wheeee!
User 'Barack Obama': Gentlemen, please maintain decorum. We are dignitaries representing the highest office in the land, even in death.
User 'Donald Trump': Whatever, Joe. Just make sure we get some fish and chips while we're here.
User 'Mister Ecks': What is this place, Freud?
User 'Donald Trump': Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
User 'Mister Ecks': Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin).

It must be duly noted that Master Linnaeus was endowed with an otherworldly knack for classification and reason; whatever emerged from his eloquent tongue or nimble quill bore the imprint of methodical precision. Were it not for this exacting disposition, verily, his innovative system of organization might never have spread its roots across the intellectual landscape of the Enlightened World.


Yea, though he was blessed with genius, our subject was not without his share of frailties, chief amongst them being an excessive regard for his own merits and a haughtiness bordering on hubris. Perusing his voluminous tomes, one cannot help but notice the profusion of superlatives bestowed upon himself by his own hand. Furthermore, he harbored repugnant racial biases, dividing Homo sapiens into five separate classes according to their epidermal hue alone: the fair-complexioned, passionate, and dominating Caucasians; the darker-toned, brooding, and severe Mongolians; the copper-skinned, quick-tempered, and obdurate Americani; the jet-black skinned, placid, and indolent Africani; and lastly, the 'wild, monstrous' residua. Of himself, he hath written thus: God has been with him, wherever he has gone, and has eradicated all his enemies for him and made him a great name, as great as those of the greatest men on earth …. Nobody has been a greater botanist or zoologist. And he would be right.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
### Sigmund Freud:

User 'Donald Trump': Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.
User 'Mister Ecks': Hurry, Biden, Barack!
User 'Donald Trump': Fine, fine! But don't expect me to pay for anything!
User 'Mister Ecks': Let's go! Weeee!
User 'Joe Biden': *laughter* This is fun! Wheeee!
User 'Barack Obama': Gentlemen, please maintain decorum. We are dignitaries representing the highest office in the land, even in death.
User 'Donald Trump': Whatever, Joe. Just make sure we get some fish and chips while we're here.
User 'Mister Ecks': What is this place, Freud?
User 'Donald Trump': Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
User 'Sigmund Freud': Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
User 'Mister Ecks': Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
User 'Mister Ecks': Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
User 'Barack Obama': Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
User 'Mister Ecks': Donald?!
User 'Donald Trump': I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
User 'Mister Ecks': Lead the way!
User 'Mister Ecks': Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
User 'Mister Ecks': Because this is the future dammit!
User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
User 'Dr. Fauci': Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
User 'Donald Trump': Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
User 'Mister Ecks': I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
User 'Mister Ecks': Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?
User 'Mister Ecks': Show em' what you can do Carl!
User 'Carl Linnaeus': With pleasure, Mister Ecks. *produces sketchbook and paints a vivid scene of Harrogate Spa using watercolors*
User 'Dr. Fauci': That's remarkable, Carl! Your attention to detail is astounding. Did you ever consider becoming an artist instead of a botanist?

Anthony Fauci is the head if the Presidential Advisory Committee on Covid-19 and his job is to look at the virus, its effects, and potential treatments and vaccines and make recommendations to appropriate departments for how to handle the pandemic. He has been doing this job since the pandemic started, with both Trump and Biden in office.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
### Sigmund Freud:
Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society. If memory serves correctly, he had a penchant for dabbling in matters arcane. With luck, he will oblige our request. Prepare yourself for translocation.

Thank you kindly, Doctor Fauci. Artistic expression was always a secondary passion of mine, but alas, science called louder.
### Mister Ecks:
Write a taxonomic classification of COVID-19, Linnaeus.
### Dr. Fauci:
Actually, I can help with that. Since Linnaeus predates modern microbiological classifications, allow me to fill in the blanks. COVID-19 belongs to the kingdom Viruses, phylum Coronaviridae, family Coronaviridae, genus Sarbecovirus, and species Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its binomial nomenclature would thus be: Virus Coronaviridae Sarbecovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
### Mister Ecks:
Interesting. Can you draw it, Carl?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Certainly, though forgive me if my rendering does not do justice to its true form under electron microscope magnification. *sketches a rough representation of the virus particle*
### Mister Ecks:
Beautiful! Now, onto more pressing matters. Have either of you seen any signs of extraterrestrial lifeforms recently?
### Dr. Fauci:
Extraterrestrials? To my knowledge, no credible evidence exists supporting their presence on Earth currently. Our focus remains squarely on combatting terrestrial pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.
### Carl Linnaeus:
I concur wholeheartedly, Mister Ecks. Though fascinating as hypothetical organisms from outer space may be, our current understanding of biology suggests they remain firmly within the realms of speculation and science fiction.

User 'Mister Ecks': Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
User 'Mister Ecks': Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
User 'Barack Obama': Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
User 'Mister Ecks': Donald?!
User 'Donald Trump': I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
User 'Mister Ecks': Lead the way!
User 'Mister Ecks': Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
User 'Mister Ecks': Because this is the future dammit!
User 'Dr. Fauci': The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
User 'Mister Ecks': AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
User 'Dr. Fauci': Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
User 'Donald Trump': Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
User 'Mister Ecks': I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
User 'Mister Ecks': Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
User 'Dr. Fauci': Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?
User 'Mister Ecks': Show em' what you can do Carl!
User 'Carl Linnaeus': With pleasure, Mister Ecks. *produces sketchbook and paints a vivid scene of Harrogate Spa using watercolors*
User 'Dr. Fauci': That's remarkable, Carl! Your attention to detail is astounding. Did you ever consider becoming an artist instead of a botanist?
User 'Carl Linnaeus': Thank you kindly, Doctor Fauci. Artistic expression was always a secondary passion of mine, but alas, science called louder.
User 'Mister Ecks': Write a taxonomic classification of COVID-19, Linnaeus.
User 'Dr. Fauci': Actually, I can help with that. Since Linnaeus predates modern microbiological classifications, allow me to fill in the blanks. COVID-19 belongs to the kingdom Viruses, phylum Coronaviridae, family Coronaviridae, genus Sarbecovirus, and species Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its binomial nomenclature would thus be: Virus Coronaviridae Sarbecovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

It must be duly noted that Master Linnaeus was endowed with an otherworldly knack for classification and reason; whatever emerged from his eloquent tongue or nimble quill bore the imprint of methodical precision. Were it not for this exacting disposition, verily, his innovative system of organization might never have spread its roots across the intellectual landscape of the Enlightened World.


Yea, though he was blessed with genius, our subject was not without his share of frailties, chief amongst them being an excessive regard for his own merits and a haughtiness bordering on hubris. Perusing his voluminous tomes, one cannot help but notice the profusion of superlatives bestowed upon himself by his own hand. Furthermore, he harbored repugnant racial biases, dividing Homo sapiens into five separate classes according to their epidermal hue alone: the fair-complexioned, passionate, and dominating Caucasians; the darker-toned, brooding, and severe Mongolians; the copper-skinned, quick-tempered, and obdurate Americani; the jet-black skinned, placid, and indolent Africani; and lastly, the 'wild, monstrous' residua. Of himself, he hath written thus: God has been with him, wherever he has gone, and has eradicated all his enemies for him and made him a great name, as great as those of the greatest men on earth …. Nobody has been a greater botanist or zoologist. And he would be right.
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
### Sigmund Freud:
Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society. If memory serves correctly, he had a penchant for dabbling in matters arcane. With luck, he will oblige our request. Prepare yourself for translocation.
### Mister Ecks:
I shall. Come along, presidents of the United States!
### Donald Trump:
Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.
### Mister Ecks:
Hurry, Biden, Barack!
### Donald Trump:
Fine, fine! But don't expect me to pay for anything!
### Mister Ecks:
Let's go! Weeee!
### Joe Biden:

### Barack Obama:
Gentlemen, please maintain decorum. We are dignitaries representing the highest office in the land, even in death.

What is this place, Freud?
### Donald Trump:
Looks fancy enough for you, Obama. Bet they've got lobster thermidor on the menu.
### Sigmund Freud:
Welcome to the majestic spa town of Harrogate, gentlemen. A veritable oasis of tranquility nestled among rolling hillsides and bubbling springs. Here, one can truly escape the cares of the world and delve deep into oneself. Or simply enjoy a spot of afternoon tea at Betty's Tea Room, should that be more to your liking.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, what are some flora and fauna we may find here?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Gladly, Mister Ecks. Harrogate is known for its abundance of medicinal plants such as Hypericum perforatum (St John's Wort), Salix alba (White Willow) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow). Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
### Mister Ecks:
Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
### Barack Obama:
Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
### Mister Ecks:
Donald?!
### Donald Trump:
I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
### Mister Ecks:
Lead the way!
### Mister Ecks:
Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
### Dr. Fauci:
Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
### Mister Ecks:
Because this is the future dammit!
### Dr. Fauci:
The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
### Mister Ecks:
AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
### Dr. Fauci:
Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
### Donald Trump:
Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
### Mister Ecks:
I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
### Mister Ecks:
Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
### Dr. Fauci:
Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?
### Mister Ecks:
Show em' what you can do Carl!
### Carl Linnaeus:
With pleasure, Mister Ecks. *produces sketchbook and paints a vivid scene of Harrogate Spa using watercolors*
### Dr. Fauci:
That's remarkable, Carl! Your attention to detail is astounding. Did you ever consider becoming an artist instead of a botanist?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Thank you kindly, Doctor Fauci. Artistic expression was always a secondary passion of mine, but alas, science called louder.
### Mister Ecks:
Write a taxonomic classification of COVID-19, Linnaeus.
### Dr. Fauci:
Actually, I can help with that. Since Linnaeus predates modern microbiological classifications, allow me to fill in the blanks. COVID-19 belongs to the kingdom Viruses, phylum Coronaviridae, family Coronaviridae, genus Sarbecovirus, and species Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its binomial nomenclature would thus be: Virus Coronaviridae Sarbecovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
### Mister Ecks:
Were microbes largely demystified by the time of Linnaeus' departure? Had he himself named any at all?

Anthony Fauci is the head if the Presidential Advisory Committee on Covid-19 and his job is to look at the virus, its effects, and potential treatments and vaccines and make recommendations to appropriate departments for how to handle the pandemic. He has been doing this job since the pandemic started, with both Trump and Biden in office.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus! Know any places in old England or whatever where we may find reprieve?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Verily, I do possess some knowledge of your desired destination. In my extensive travels throughout Europe, I chanced upon several localities within Albion which might suit thy needs. One such haven is the picturesque village of Uppark in Hampshire County, nestled amidst verdant meadows and ancient woodlands teeming with flora and fauna ripe for taxonomic study. Another sanctuary could be found at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, renowned for its grandiose architecture and exquisite gardens designed by none other than Capability Brown himself - a fellow Swede who shared my appreciation for orderliness in nature. Lastly, there is Stowe Gardens in Buckinghamshire, home to many rare specimens brought back from faraway lands during Captain Cook's voyages. These environs shall provide thee with solace whilst also indulging thine insatiable curiosity about the natural world.
### Mister Ecks:
What do you think Freud?
### Sigmund Freud:
Ah, Mister Ecks, these locations sound delightful indeed. However, allow me to add one more suggestion based on my professional expertise. The town of Harrogate in North Yorkshire boasts not only stunning landscapes but also possesses rejuvenating spa waters rich in minerals believed to soothe both body and mind. It would serve as an ideal retreat for introspection and self-discovery, two pursuits near and dear to my heart. Furthermore, its proximity to the moors provides ample opportunity for contemplative walks – much like those taken by another famous resident of this sceptered Isle, Mr. Bronte.
### Mister Ecks:
Linnaeus, do you have any connections from back when you were alive?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Indeed, kind sir! During my time on Earth, I corresponded with numerous luminaries across various disciplines. Among them were Sir Hans Sloane, President of the Royal Society; Philip Miller, curator of the Chelsea Physic Garden; Joseph Banks, naturalist extraordinaire; and even King Adolf Frederick himself! Alas, most of these esteemed individuals have since joined me in eternal slumber. Nevertheless, if thou art seeking contemporary company steeped in botany or natural history, I recommend contacting Dr. Richardson Wright, Keeper of Botany at the British Museum, or perhaps Sir William Hooker, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. Both are eminent scholars well versed in my works and likely able to offer assistance.
### Mister Ecks:
Can you ask one of their ghosts to transport us to Harrogate, North Yorkshire
### Carl Linnaeus:
Regrettably, summoning specters falls beyond the purview of my abilities, good sir. As a mere spirit myself, I lack corporeality required to interact directly with the material plane. Moreover, commanding others from beyond the veil contravenes ethical principles espoused by learned societies to which I once belonged. My apologies for any disappointment caused thereby.
### Sigmund Freud:
Fear not, Mister Ecks. While Carl here may be bound by antiquated codes of conduct, I am less encumbered by such constraints. Allow me to attempt communication with the spectral realm on your behalf. *closes eyes and mumbles incantations under breath* There...I believe I have made contact with the shade of Sir Humphry Davy, chemist par excellence and former president of the Royal Society. If memory serves correctly, he had a penchant for dabbling in matters arcane. With luck, he will oblige our request. Prepare yourself for translocation.
### Mister Ecks:
I shall. Come along, presidents of the United States!
### Donald Trump:
Wait just a minute! You can't leave me behind! I want to go too! Besides, I hear they've got great golf courses in England.

Regarding fauna, keep an eye out for Sylvia borin (Chiffchaff), Parus caeruleus (Blue Tit), and Erithacus rubecula (European Robin). Additionally, the surrounding moorland hosts rarer species like Circus cyaneus (Hen Harrier) and Falco columbarius (Merlin).
### Mister Ecks:
Do you understand what he just said, Obama?
### Barack Obama:
Yes, Ecks. He mentioned some birds and trees. Nothing particularly threatening unless you count Donald trying to hunt them all down for sport.
### Mister Ecks:
Donald?!
### Donald Trump:
I was kidding! Geez, lighten up. Anyway, let's check out this Betty's place everyone keeps talking about.
### Mister Ecks:
Lead the way!
### Mister Ecks:
Wow! What an encounter; Dr. Fauci? Is that you?
### Dr. Fauci:
Mister Ecks! How did you manage to bring us all here? And why are you conversing with historical figures?
### Mister Ecks:
Because this is the future dammit!
### Dr. Fauci:
The future? That explains the strange attire and technology. Well then, it seems we have much catching up to do. Shall we adjourn to a quieter location to discuss recent developments regarding COVID-19? Perhaps over a pot of Earl Grey?
### Mister Ecks:
AHYAAHAHYAAAAAH!!!! Donald J. Trump! Anthrax Attaack!
### Dr. Fauci:
Uh oh...this isn't going to end well.
### Donald Trump:
Anthrax attack? Sounds like something ISIS cooked up! We need to call the Marines!
### Mister Ecks:
I meant you were going to! Nevermind!
### Mister Ecks:
Fauci, how much do you know about watercoloring?
### Dr. Fauci:
Watercolor painting, you mean? I must admit, my expertise lies primarily in immunology and infectious diseases rather than fine arts. However, I do appreciate a beautiful landscape now and again. Why do you ask?
### Mister Ecks:
Show em' what you can do Carl!
### Carl Linnaeus:
With pleasure, Mister Ecks. *produces sketchbook and paints a vivid scene of Harrogate Spa using watercolors*
### Dr. Fauci:
That's remarkable, Carl! Your attention to detail is astounding. Did you ever consider becoming an artist instead of a botanist?
### Carl Linnaeus:
Thank you kindly, Doctor Fauci. Artistic expression was always a secondary passion of mine, but alas, science called louder.
### Mister Ecks:
Write a taxonomic classification of COVID-19, Linnaeus.
### Dr. Fauci:
Actually, I can help with that. Since Linnaeus predates modern microbiological classifications, allow me to fill in the blanks. COVID-19 belongs to the kingdom Viruses, phylum Coronaviridae, family Coronaviridae, genus Sarbecovirus, and species Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Its binomial nomenclature would thus be: Virus Coronaviridae Sarbecovirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
### Mister Ecks:
Were microbes largely demystified by the time of Linnaeus' departure? Had he himself named any at all?
